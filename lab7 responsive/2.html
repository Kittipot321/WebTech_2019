    <h1>The best indie PC games you might have missed in 2019</h1>
    <hr color="blue">
    <p>AAA video games have gotten remarkably similar to each other over the last generation, with publishers becoming
        less-willing to bet on creative and unique ideas as they focus on established franchises. Indie games — those
        created by independent developers without the backing of a major corporate publisher — don’t have this problem.

        In recent years, many indie games have managed to surpass their AAA competition in terms of quality, and the
        notion that indie games are somehow “lesser” because of their lower budget is not accurate. In fact, if you
        ignore indie games, you’re missing out on some of the best video games of all time. Here are the 4 best indie
        games you should be playing right now.</p>
