        <h1>Top 4 Free Software of 2019</h1>
    </center>
    <p class="main">Desktop operating systems like Windows and macOS don't get all the attention anymore. It's a mobile
        world, but we
        have not fully abandoned the desktop. The real work (and a lot of the play) of computing requires a full
        personal computer system. To get the most out of that, you need software.

        Software can be expensive if you're not smart about it. Free programs have been a mainstay of the desktop
        experience for decades, and the offerings only get more powerful and fascinating. As PCs compete with
        smartphones, it gets even better. Software developers can adopt an ad-based model, donation-ware to keep things
        afloat, or a shareware/freemium model that charges for extra features.

                    <h3>Google Chrome</h3>
                    <p>It's been a leading browser since its debut in 2008, especially when it comes to speed
                        andminimalism.
                        Chrome
                        still ranks high as a browser to keep in your arsenal. Especially if you'rea devotee to Google
                        products—and
                        it's built right into the ChromeOS onChromebooks so much that it practically is the OS. However,
                        it's
                        probably not the browseryou want if you're a privacy advocate.</p>

                    <h3>CCleaner Free</h3>
                    <p>The first C is for Crap! CCleaner is practically essential for keeping a system going,
                        especiallyWindows.
                        What CCleaner does is simple: it cleans up extraneous files that gunk up the OSand browsers. Get
                        it and
                        run
                        it, regularly. It'll even delete some apps you didn't think youcould get rid of—like those
                        provided in
                        Windows 10, whether you wanted them or not.</p>

                    <h3>Foxit Reader</h3>
                    <p>Foxit Reader is free for not just reading, but also creating PDFs and collaboration on the
                        files(at least
                        you
                        can with the Windows version; Mac and Linux are more limited). Foxit'sMobilePDF apps are on iOS
                        and
                        Android.
                        What's more, they support a tech calledConnectedPDF so you can send PDF files and even update
                        them after
                        you
                        send them (thanksbe to the cloud).</p>

                    <h3>7-Zip</h3>
                    <p>Eventually in this life, you're going to run into an archive file—a single file with multiple
                        filesstored
                        (and compressed) inside it. They have different extensions, from RAR to ZIP to 7z andmany more,
                        and
                        sometimes the program to open them costs you. Not 7-Zip. It opens all ofthose and more, and
                        allows
                        creation
                        of new archives. It'll even encrypt the contents forsafety. It's entirely open source.</p>
